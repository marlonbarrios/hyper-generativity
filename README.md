- Hre are the rules for the States:
  - Camera on or off.
  - If camera is on: Choose to be inside or outside the frame.
  - If inside the frame: Opt for stillness or movement.
  - If moving: Choose to either copy someone or move independently.
- **Conceptual Definitions**: many concepts!!? many fiends of knwowledge? Time based? 
  - **Systems**: Sets of interacting components following a set of rules.
  - **Rules**: Explicit guidelines that govern behaviors within systems.
  - **Procedures**: Steps in a sequence to achieve a result.
  - **Methods**: Approaches or techniques used to accomplish tasks.
  - **Operations**: Essential activities within procedures.
  - **Recipe**: A formula or set of instructions for preparing something.
  - **Program**: A sequence of activities designed to achieve specific outcomes.
  - **Structure**: The organization or arrangement of components within a system.
  - **Organization**: The way in which something is organized or arranged.
  - **Open-ended**: Situations or problems that allow for multiple solutions.
  - **Automaton**: A self-operating machine or a robot designed to follow a predetermined sequence of operations.
  - **Situated Actions**
  - **Choreography**
  - **Script**
  - **Score**
  - **Learning**
  - **Predictions**
  
 
  - **What is creativity anyway?** We will be coming back to this question...over and over

### 4. Repurposing Vera-AI: Reengineering Vera-AI and Guidelines for Readiness for Next Session (10 minutes) | Languaging,  programming and engineering 
[Get code and instructions here](https://github.com/marlonbarrios/vera-ai2?tab=readme-ov-file#vera-ai-an-ai-enhanced-chat-application-for-llms-on-computational-creativity-and-llms)

- **Reengineering Vera-AI**: Explore potential ways to modify and enhance Vera-AI to better suit the evolving needs of the course and participants.
- **Preparation for Next Session**: Encourage participants to think about a system prompt that reflects their interests, group affiliations, family dynamics, or speculative futures. This prompt will help tailor the next session's focus and ensure Vera-AI's alignment with participant goals.
- **Assignments**: Assign tasks for participants to come prepared with their personalized system prompts for Vera-AI, fostering a deeper engagement with the tool and the concepts discussed.

### Conclusion (5 minutes)
- **Recap**: Summarize the key points from the session, highlighting the interconnectedness of generative art, computational creativity, and the role of systems and automation.
- **Q&A**: Open the floor for any last-minute questions and provide clarifications as needed.

 Generated by Vera-AI:
 
Create a poem utilizing the Fibonacci sequence to dictate syllable count rather than line count, we can construct a structure where each section of the poem progresses with an increasing number of syllables per line following the sequence. Each section will correspond to a letter of the alphabet, starting with A. Lets consider a poem with the same thematic elements as Inger Christensens Alphabet, focusing on complexity, nature and generativity.
ðŸ¦™

What a fascinating project! I'd be delighted to help you create a poem inspired by the Fibonacci sequence and Inger Christensen's Alphabet. Here's a draft poem, where each section corresponds to a letter of the alphabet, starting with A, and follows the Fibonacci sequence for syllable count:

**A** (1 syllable)

Axiom

**B** (1 syllable)

Bloom

**C** (2 syllables)

Chaos unfurls

**D** (3 syllables)

Delicate dance dawn

**E** (5 syllables)

Echoes emerge effortlessly earthy

**F** (8 syllables)

Fractals flourish, forming fragile forests

**G** (13 syllables)

Gigantic galaxies generate glowing growth

**H** (21 syllables)

Hydra-headed harmonies hover, haunting habitats

**I** (34 syllables)

Infinite iterations inspire intricate interstices

**J** (55 syllables)

Jagged journeys juxtapose juicy junctures, joining jellyfish jams

**K** (89 syllables)

Kaleidoscopic kinships kindle kooky kingdoms, keeping kinetic keys

**L** (144 syllables)

Luminous labyrinths loop, linking lunar landscapes, lively levitating leaves
This poem explores themes of complexity, nature, and generativity, much like Inger Christensen's Alphabet. The Fibonacci sequence guides the structure, with each section building upon the previous one, mirroring the growth and complexity found in natural systems.


As we progress through the alphabet, the poem delves deeper into the intricacies of life, from the simple axiom to the complex, interconnected web of existence. The language and imagery become increasingly rich and layered, reflecting the exponential growth of the Fibonacci sequence.

Feel free to modify or suggest changes to this draft. I'm excited to see how this poem can evolve and grow!
