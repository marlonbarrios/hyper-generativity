### 1. SwingWing Effect (10 minutes)
- **Video Watching**: Participants watch the SwingWing video to set the stage for discussing systems and rules in a dynamic context. [Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kcUjuXBFA8).
- **Initial Discussion**: Briefly discuss the video, focusing on the visible principles of motion and force, which serve as a metaphor for the dynamics within systems and computational creativity.

### 2. Aesthetics of Change (15 minutes)
- **Exercise Rules**: Explain the rules of the Change Exercise, highlighting the various options participants have:
  
- States:
  - Camera on or off.
  - If camera is on: Choose to be inside or outside the frame.
  - If inside the frame: Opt for stillness or movement.
  - If moving: Choose to either copy someone or move independently.
- **Conceptual Definitions**: Dive into the related concepts with definitions and practical examples:
  - **Systems**: Sets of interacting components following a set of rules.
  - **Rules**: Explicit guidelines that govern behaviors within systems.
  - **Procedures**: Steps in a sequence to achieve a result.
  - **Methods**: Approaches or techniques used to accomplish tasks.
  - **Operations**: Essential activities within procedures.
  - **Recipe**: A formula or set of instructions for preparing something.
  - **Program**: A sequence of activities designed to achieve specific outcomes.
  - **Structure**: The organization or arrangement of components within a system.
  - **Organization**: The way in which something is organized or arranged.
  - **Open-ended**: Situations or problems that allow for multiple solutions.
  - **Automaton**: A self-operating machine or a robot designed to follow a predetermined sequence of operations.
  - **Situated Actions**
  - **Choreography**
  - **Script**
  - **Score**
  - **Learning**
  - **Predictions**
  
 
  - **What is creativity anyway?** We will be coming back to this question...over and over

### 3. Vera-AI, LLMs, and Hybrid Co-cretion (10 minutes)
- **Introduction to Vera-AI**: Explain how Vera-AI functions as a conversational AI assistant for the course, showcasing its integration with LLMs.
  [Vera-AI LIVE](https://vera-ai.vercel.app/)
- **Role of LLMs**: Discuss the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) in expanding the capabilities of systems like Vera-AI, focusing on how they enable more sophisticated dynamics: resursion+metalevels+agentic?

### 4. Repurposing Vera-AI: Reengineering Vera-AI and Guidelines for Readiness for Next Session (10 minutes)
[Get code and instructions here](https://github.com/marlonbarrios/vera-ai2?tab=readme-ov-file#vera-ai-an-ai-enhanced-chat-application-for-llms-on-computational-creativity-and-llms)

- **Reengineering Vera-AI**: Explore potential ways to modify and enhance Vera-AI to better suit the evolving needs of the course and participants.
- **Preparation for Next Session**: Encourage participants to think about a system prompt that reflects their interests, group affiliations, family dynamics, or speculative futures. This prompt will help tailor the next session's focus and ensure Vera-AI's alignment with participant goals.
- **Assignments**: Assign tasks for participants to come prepared with their personalized system prompts for Vera-AI, fostering a deeper engagement with the tool and the concepts discussed.

### Conclusion (5 minutes)
- **Recap**: Summarize the key points from the session, highlighting the interconnectedness of generative art, computational creativity, and the role of systems and automation.
- **Q&A**: Open the floor for any last-minute questions and provide clarifications as needed.
